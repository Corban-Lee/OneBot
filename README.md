# Derby-College-Bot
 A custom bot for the student-run Derby College Discord server

## Setup

To run this bot, you will need to provide it with a token to use. This can be done by creating a file called `TOKEN` in the root directory of the project, and putting the token in here. The bot will then read the token from that file.
