# Derby College Bot
 A custom bot for the student-run Derby College Discord server

## Setup

### Token

To run this bot, you will need to provide it with a token to use. This can be done by creating a file called `TOKEN` in the root directory of the project, and putting the token in here. The bot will then read the token from that file.

### Config

There are various commands you can use to configure the bot from your discord client. These are:
- /purpose
### Database

The database file will be automatically created when you run the bot for the first time. It will be called `db.sqlite3` and will be in the root directory of the project.

### FFMPEG

FFMPEG is required to use the music functionality of the bot, otherwise it is not needed.
Download ffmpeg from [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z), then take the files from the 'downloaded folder/bin' and drop them into a new directory 'ffmpeg/' at the root of the project directory.
