# Derby College Bot
 A custom bot for the student-run Derby College Discord server

## Setup

To run this bot, you will need to provide it with a token to use. This can be done by creating a file called `TOKEN` in the root directory of the project, and putting the token in here. The bot will then read the token from that file.

## Development Plans

- [ ] Add a command to allow users to add their own roles
- [ ] Add a cog that will pull memes from Reddit daily to keep certain channels active
- [ ] Implement music playback for voice channels
- [x] Create a ticket system for users to request help from staff
- [x] Create a ticket system for users to suggest new server features
- [ ] Refine the ticket system to be cleaner and easy to use
